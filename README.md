This project is part of free javascript course from scrimba.com.
I did it way back, but now I tried to do it on my own with some CSS styling and additional two buttons.
I did, however, use some google help to get it in present state.
Uploded using CLI and git.

Live project [here](https://b4c1c.github.io/calculator-javascript/)

Hope you like it!
